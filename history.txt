FORTRAN/TK History
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Version 0.6 beta:
 * Added the "evname" and "evarg" character*256 functions.
   "evname" returns the name of a given event and "evarg"
   returns the optional argument of the event (everything after the event
   name will be passed in quotes after the name to the TkWait-function).
   -> Used these functions in the Editor example.
 * Improved the source of the Calculator example.
 * Replaced the command and batch files with easy to use makefiles.
   Look in the readme.txt for more details.
 * Added the missing "rexxtran.dll" to the "examples\binos2\runtime"-directory.

Version 0.5 beta:
 * Complete extensive source code make over
 * Using a special path for the DLLs is now possible (with the TkInit
   command).
 * Solved problem with TkUnload under Windows.
 * Partly new documentation (examples, source code, new README...)
 * Completed the Calculator example (e.g. with pasting/copying from/to clipboard)
 * Added Editor example (edit.for)
 * Using IF/ELSEIF construction instead of SELECT blocks for event loops in
   FORTRAN/TK programs (so there are no more problems with string comparation)
   -> Added small CMP function to simplify the process
 * Windows 2000: Solved problem on exit (threw an error) -> Using TkDestroy with
   the main window to avoid (e.g. in examples)
 * Added the remaining Rexx/Tk functions (e.g. Rexx/Tk extensions)
 * Solved problems with Tk-functions, when they are called  with similar
   arguments: had to manually reset the return value by an additional Assembler
   subroutine
 * Added the following additional FORTRAN/TK functions (extensions):
   str2int/str2real, int2str/real2str, GetCurDir, ChangeDir, LoadModule, FreeModule,
   DllGetAddress, GetClipboard, SetClipboard, CloseClipbrd, CDRoot
   (addition for TkInit), CreateDir, CreateFile, DeleteFile, DeleteDir, MessageBeep,
   GetFirstFile, GetNextFile, CloseSearch, GetFileAttrib, SetFileAttrib, cmp
 * FORTRAN/TK is now compiled as a library
 * Extended (function) versions:
   Allow to exceed the 256 byte maximum of ordinary FORTRAN/TK functions (character*256)
   by returning an RXSTRING structure instead, so the use can allocate the whole
   space.
   Functions: TkCgetEx, TkConfigEx, TkCurSelectionEx, TkFontFamiliesEx, TkGetEx,
              TkGetConfigEx, TkGridInfoEx, TkGridSlavesEx, TkVarEx, TkVariableEx,
              TkMCListboxColumnCgetEx, TkTreeGetSelectionEx, TkComboboxListGetEx,
              GetClipboardEx
 * Tk-Functions return CHAR(0) if the available space is insufficient
 * Added FORTRAN/TK Icon
 * ...

Version 0.1 alpha:
 * INITIAL RELEASE
 * Access to most of the Rexx/Tk functions
 * 2 example files (calc.for and example.for)
